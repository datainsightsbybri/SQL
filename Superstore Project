#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices.

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#maximum price 
SELECT max(price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Appliances".
SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Appliances";

#Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT min(price)
FROM superstore;

#Show a statistic about the average rating.
SELECT max(average_rating)
FROM superstore;

#list of all items in order by average rating ascending
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY average_rating;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 
SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"

#How can this answer business problems or help a business out.
Example: By ordering items by price, the business can identify high-value products 
and adjust pricing strategies accordingly. Understanding the average prices of items in different 
categories, such as "Appliances" and "Kitchen Supplies," can help in setting competitive pricing.

Additionally, analyzing the average ratings of items can help in understanding customer preferences and 
identifying popular products that can be promoted further.

Presenting these findings in a comprehensive report using Tableau or Power BI, along with visualizations 
generated from SQL queries, can provide stakeholders with clear, actionable insights to improve sales strategies, 
optimize inventory management, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
